# Role Playing Game Manager

RPG Manager is an Obsidian plugin to simplify the creation and running of role playing game campaings. The plugin is system-agnostic, which means you can use it if you are running a D&D, Call of Chtulhu or any other TTRPG.

## How to use RPG Manager

Once installed, you can create your first campaign and start adding all the elements you are using or you plan to use.

### Elements

`Elements` are the building blocks of RPG Manager and identify a specific part of a campaign.

### Element Types

| Element               | Description                                                                                                                                                                  |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Campaign              | A campaign is a storyline, usually played with the same players and in the same world.                                                                                       |
| Adventure             | An adventure is a part of your story, normally associated to a story circle (if you like to plot), or an event or location that create the setup for your player characters. |
| Chapter               | Sometimes our adventures are quite beefy, in such case you can split them into multiple chapters!                                                                            |
| Session               | One game session. You can create it to take notes, or to plan it in advance.                                                                                                 |
| Scene                 | If you, like me, like to give a good rythm to the game                                                                                                                       |
| Non-player characters |                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Events                |                                                                                                                                                                              |

### Attributes

The attributes are all the information that can be associated to an element. Every element type has a set of pre-defined attributes, and you can decide which ones to use; however, should you need to expand and refine the attributes to use, you can easily create your custom attributes.

### Relationships

One of the key elements in the plugin is the ability to create relationships between elements. These relationships are links between two elements will help you navigate through your notes.

### Tasks

As a storyteller, I often find myself in need to take a note to do something for my campaigns. This could be better defining a non-player character or adding a note to myself to incorporate in future sessions. RPG Manager includes a system of tasks you can create in any element and assign in others.

## Plotters or Sandboxers

RPG Manager fully embraces two ways of planning a campaign: plotting its story or sandboxing its adventures. Whoever you are, you can use the plugin as you like.

If you are a plotter, you could find the Story Circle attribute beneficial to structure a storyline.

If you are a sandboxer, you can plan clues to give your players agency to move forward.

## ChatGPT integration

Starting from small elements (so far only the _Non-player character creation wizard_ and the _Sensory Imprint_)

### Privacy notice

RPG Manager does _NOT_ send any infomration to third party servers, as long as you do not add a valid ChatGPT API Key.
In that case, the plugin sends some information about your campaign to OpenAI, **exclusively when you request it**.

## F.A.Q.

**Q**: Can I help?

Of course you can. RPG Manager is open source, and you can propose new features or solve pesky bugs.
