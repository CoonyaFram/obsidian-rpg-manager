## Plots and Elements

### Campaign

A campaign contains the overarching plot that will drive every session played. It is the story of a non player character
that creates the world around the player characters. The campaign is the pillar of every story and its adventures should
link into it. The campaign focuses on a non-player character because it is the beginning of the world building with
which your player characters will interact.

```example
Jessica Shear was on an excursion on Mount Rainer with the South Puget Sound Community College of Olympia, where in a 
terrain depression near the Blue Lake she discovered a long forgotten Satanic Temple and an occult tome that could put 
her in touch with the Devil and she contacted the Devil and killed Alexander Stoner and Felipe Cavaglio in order to 
seal a pact with the Devil that is giving her beauty and great powers, but she realised that the Devil wants her to 
fail to complete her side of the pact, so she will be forever bound to his will she is gaining more strength to perform 
two additional murdering rituals before the Devil can stop her, fulfilling her side of the pact and being released from 
his will, while maintaining even greater powers.
```

### Adventure

An adventure is a self-contained story inside a campaign. Differently from the campaign, the plot of an adventure
focuses on the player characters. Following the [ABT and Story Circle plotting style](#a-note-about-plotting), every
adventure must provide the player characters a need to embark in the adventure. This is normally called the "**plot
hook**".

The adventure should focus on moving the player characters in a journey of need, search, challenges and success, hence
why I generally suggest to split each adventure in four acts.
